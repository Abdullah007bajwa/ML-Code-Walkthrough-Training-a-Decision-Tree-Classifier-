# README for ML Code Walkthrough: Training a Decision Tree Classifier üå≥

This repository provides a complete walkthrough for training and evaluating a **Decision Tree Classifier** on the **Iris dataset**. Ideal for beginners in machine learning, it covers essential steps like loading the dataset, splitting the data, training the model, making predictions, and analyzing the results.

## Project Overview üìã

This project demonstrates the basics of using a Decision Tree for a simple classification task, specifically classifying species of iris flowers based on features like petal and sepal dimensions. This example is useful for understanding fundamental machine learning concepts and provides a hands-on approach to model evaluation.

## Notebook Walkthrough üìö

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Necessary libraries include `scikit-learn` for machine learning tools and `pandas` for data management.
   
   ```python
   from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
   import pandas as pd
   ```

2. **Load and Explore the Data**  
   We use the classic **Iris dataset**, which consists of 150 samples across three classes of iris flowers. The dataset has four features, each representing a characteristic of the flowers.

   ```python
   data = load_iris()
   X = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)
   y = pd.Series(data.target, name="species")
   ```

3. **Data Splitting**  
   Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

   ```python
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
   ```

4. **Model Initialization and Training**  
   Initialize the Decision Tree Classifier and train it on the training data.

   ```python
   model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

5. **Making Predictions**  
   Use the trained model to predict the species on the test data.

   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate model performance using **accuracy score** and **classification report** to understand precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

   ```python
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
   print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
   print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
   ```

7. **Feature Importance**  
   Check feature importances to understand which features the model considers most predictive.

   ```python
   feature_importances = pd.Series(model.feature_importances_, index=data.feature_names).sort_values(ascending=False)
   print("\nFeature Importances:\n", feature_importances)
   ```

## Key Results and Insights üìà

- **Accuracy**: Achieved a perfect accuracy score on the Iris dataset, making it an excellent starting project for understanding decision tree classifiers.
- **Feature Importance**: `petal length (cm)` was identified as the most critical feature in distinguishing the species, followed by `petal width (cm)`.
